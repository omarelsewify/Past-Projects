1) I agree with this statement. I believe it is my responsibility to keep any data shared with me private and anything about myself private. This is very important as there may be data on my devices which could be potentially used with bad intentions and adversely affect those around me. I also should keep my own information private because it protects me from data miners and hackers.

2) Privacy from Allen's definition is a degree of inaccessibility of persons, their mental states and information about them to the senses and surveillance of others. I think tech companies owe it to their users to encrypt the data stored or transmitted on their devices. Especially, in the case of cell phones, which have become necessities to daily life, they are always on or near to their owners and hold all types of private information. There should be a feeling of safety and secureness when using your phone or when you access data on it, the sense of feeling solitude while doing this is essential.
